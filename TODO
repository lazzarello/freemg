6 channel trigger thresholds may effect a 6 channel granular synthesizer. Each channel can be manipulated by increasing
the number of grains as the input values increase

rhythmic guitar pattern looping. two channels effect timestretched buffer of the mixed audio loop. more data produces a slower loop with
the same pitch. four channels effect the volume of 4 samples.

channel zero (lombar, back) does not produce data often but has a large visual consequence when it does. make it a
threshold trigger to change the looped sample.
