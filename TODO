__TODO__
make patch for dorkbot demo with pet synth and sinewave crossfader
particlechamber mapping
aggregate abstraction scaling
copy serial input enabler from arduino-input.pd
port firmware loading abstraction to emg-test

__NOTES__
particle chamber. envelope and length are two most important parameters for live manipulation. Asynch and Vox relate to
each other and produce more chaos as they are increased

rhythmic guitar pattern looping. two channels effect timestretched buffer of the mixed audio loop. more data produces a slower loop with
the same pitch. four channels effect the volume of 4 samples.

channel zero (lombar, back) does not produce data often but has a large visual consequence when it does. make it a
threshold trigger to change the looped sample. make it store a single random value and output that when the threshold
first exits the range.
