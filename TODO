6 channel trigger thresholds may effect a 6 channel granular synthesizer. Each channel can be manipulated by increasing
the number of grains as the input values increase

State transitions dont work very well with fluid movement. jagged movement also doesn't accurately reflect the change of
state. I do not believe that trigger thresholds are a good primary sound source.

rhythmic guitar pattern looping. each channel effects the timestretch ofthe loop. more data produces a slower loop with
the same pitch.

channel zero (lombar, back) does not produce data often but has a large visual consequence when it does. perhaps a
threshold trigger may work there to change the looped sample.
