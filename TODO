init firmware on arduino sync
breathing and haieeee samples onload
create equal pressure curve for crossfader
use bonk~ for sample changes on attack detection

__NOTES__
rhythmic guitar pattern looping. two channels effect timestretched buffer of the mixed audio loop. more data produces a slower loop with
the same pitch. four channels effect the volume of 4 samples.
