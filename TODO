__TODO__
make crossfader
why is the CPU consuption for incoming serial data so high?
allow sliders to accept range parameters
allow emg object to accept configuration symbols for buffer length
refine serial input enabler from arduino-input.pd
port firmware loading abstraction to emg-test

__NOTES__

rhythmic guitar pattern looping. two channels effect timestretched buffer of the mixed audio loop. more data produces a slower loop with
the same pitch. four channels effect the volume of 4 samples.
