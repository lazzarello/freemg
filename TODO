__TODO__
refine serial input enabler from arduino-input.pd
make crossfader
port firmware loading abstraction to emg-test

__NOTES__

rhythmic guitar pattern looping. two channels effect timestretched buffer of the mixed audio loop. more data produces a slower loop with
the same pitch. four channels effect the volume of 4 samples.
why is the CPU consuption for incoming serial data so high?
