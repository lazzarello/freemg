This code is the engine for the Electromyographone instrument for transforming voluntary movement from the human body
into sound. It gives voice to free will. The remainder of the instrument will also be documented, though this is the
only software component, so it was added as a git repository first.

Created in collaboration with Torino::Margolis and Dana Kotler.
